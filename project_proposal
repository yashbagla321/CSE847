\section{Problem Description}
In this work I propose to present an approximation inspired by locally linear regression techniques to the standard GPR using local Gaussian processes model. \cite{Incremental_Online_Learning}
I will follow this paper by Duy Nguyen-Tuong, Jan Peters, Matthias Seeger and implement some of the more successful approaches in Support Vector Regression (SVR).
I will evaluate these procedures in terms of Model-based control, e.g. torque control, locally weighted projection regression (LWPR).

Robot control requires accurate dynamics models which cannot be obtained analytically for sufficiently complex robot systems to get high performance and compliant. In such cases, machine learning offers a promising alternative for approximating the robot dynamics using measured data. A natural framework to incorporate unknown nonlinearities as well as to continually adapt online for changes in the robot dynamics is something this approach offers. However, the most accurate regression methods, e.g. Gaussian processes regression (GPR) and support vector regression (SVR), suffer from exceptional high computational complexity which prevents their usage for large numbers of samples or online learning to date.\cite{GPR_for_robot_control}
\section{Related Work}

There is considerable literature in robot control using learning through GPR. Earlier work has
touched upon Locally weighted projection regression (LWPR) which uses a small number of univariate regressions in selected directions in input space in the spirit of partial least squares regression,\cite{Incremental_Online_Learning}
control algorithms for learning and compensating for the dynamics of manipulators during the motion are presented and tested experimentally the resulting control performances are better than with measured parameters for any trajectory in the workspace
 \cite{nonlinear_adaptive_control}
When using unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for control applications, learning to place the sigma points correctly from data can make sigma point collapse much less likely. Learning can result in a significant increase in predictive performance over default settings of the parameters in the UKF and other filters designed to avoid the problems of the UKF, such as the GP-ADF. At the same time, we maintain a lower computational complexity than the other methods. \cite{unscented_Kalman_filtering}

\section{Project Milestones}
This section will detail milestones so that I can roughly organize my work
toward the completion of this project.
\begin{itemize}
\item Prepare a proposal and survey important literature
\item Dig deeper into the literature and search for implementational details
\item Clean, organize and explore the data. Include or remove clinical covariates as necessary.
\item Prepare the code, run and test it extensively on example data. Decide if simulations will be necessary.
\item Prepare a second draft with a detailed introduction and some results based on exploration.
\item Run the alogrithms on the Data allocation and Model Learning.
\item Run the alogrithms on Weighted Prediction, and collect the results. Prepare summaries and visualizations.
\item Prepare Final Report
\end{itemize}
